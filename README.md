# Haptic Tension (A HOI4 Buttplug-Support Mod)

### Demo
[![Demo](https://img.youtube.com/vi/9HlRy-rwwqc/0.jpg)](https://youtu.be/9HlRy-rwwqc)

Live out your guiltiest fantasies. Know what it would've felt like to be Neville Chamberlain with a humiliation kink. Experience life as \*insert some fascist whom it'd be way too insensitive to mention in this context\* if he/she was into the other kind of domination.

This mod (together with its companion apps) let HOI4 control your sex toys. As world tension increases in game, vibration increases irl.

REQUIRES two external applications since Paradox hasn't yet offered modders vibrator support.

Compatible with all mods and old saves.

Should work with any vibrating items supported by [https://buttplug.io/](https://buttplug.io):<br />

## Setup
1. Add the mod (manually or through Steam Workshop)
2. Install and run the open-source [Intiface Central](https://intiface.com/central/) tool.
3. Install and run my [helper app](https://github.com/AssplayThrowaway/Haptic-Tension/releases/).
4. Start the Intiface server.
5. Connect your device to Intiface.
6. Connect the helper app to Intiface.
7. Tell the helper app where your "Paradox Interactive" folder is.
8. Run the game with the mod enabled
9. Toggle the app on/off with Ctrl+Alt+B (Cmd+Option+B)

## Caveats
* Not ironman-compatible.
* Vibration speed doesn't update while paused.
* You have to manually toggle off the app when exiting a game.
* The app may stop doing anything if you unfocus the game or app window, but it should resume shortly after you go back to the game and unpause. (I believe this is only an issue with Xbox controllers)
* Though Mac/Linux executables are available, this was only tested on Windows.

## Lastly
I definitely don't have the luxury right now of being able to work much on a project I can't put on my resume, so post-release development is more or less not a thing. If you find a big issue, let me know and I'll probably fix it, otherwise, feel free to take whatever I've made and make your own version.
